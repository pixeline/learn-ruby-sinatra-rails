# learn Ruby, Sinatra, and rails


## Ruby
-- via [padrinoerb](http://padrinorb.com/guides/introduction/why-learn-padrino/#:~:text=TryRuby%20%E2%80%93%20This%20is,must%20be%20mentioned)

-   [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0 "TryRuby") -- This is an interactive tutorial that takes you step by step through learning Ruby. This is highly recommended. Visit the site and type "help" to get started.
-   [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram "Learn to Program") by Chris Pines -- Excellent first Ruby tutorial, straightforward and excellent overview of the language.
-   [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ "Learn Ruby the
    Hard Way") -- Newest addition to the group, based off of Zed's excellent Python tutorial. Set of exercises that teaches Ruby to you in a rigorous but simple approach.
-   [Why's Poignant Guide](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html "Why's
    Poignant Guide") - Definitely the most unorthodox way to learn Ruby, but must be mentioned.

## Sinatra

Resources for Sinatra are listed below:

-   [Sinatra Introduction](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html "Sinatra
    Introduction")
-   [Sinatra Book](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-book "Sinatra Book")
-   [Sinatra Github Repo](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra "Sinatra Github
    Repo")

There are several good Sinatra tutorials as well:

-   [Just Do It, Learn Sinatra](http://www.sitepoint.com/just-do-it-learn-sinatra-i/ "Just Do It, Learn Sinatra") -- Great step by step 3 part tutorial on Sinatra.
-   [Singing with Sinatra](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/singing-with-sinatra--net-18965 "Singing with Sinatra") -- Excellent beginners guide to learning Sinatra.
-   [Sinatra Usage Examples](http://blog.maxaller.name/2010/01/a-brief-introduction-to-ruby-sinatra-and-haml "Sinatra Usage Examples") -- Great set of examples for how to use Sinatra in code snippets.

Read through these tutorials to understand routes, helpers, and the request/response cycle that is exposed through Sinatra. The most comprehensive resource is probably the [Sinatra Book](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra-book "Sinatra Book") so make sure to skim through that and familiarize yourself with the concepts
